## Use Active Voice

*Active voice* makes the performer of the action (usually the reader or user) the subject of the sentence.

*Passive voice* makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

When compared to passive-voice sentences, active-voice sentences are:
- more engaging
- less complicated
- less wordy
- easier to understand

With active voice, you can distinguish the actions and responses of the user from those of the technology.

Beginning users look for specific calls to action in step-by-step content. Active voice makes this clear. Consider if you write a step that reads “The service can be restarted.” As written, this sentence reads as a consideration or a possibility, not an instruction. If the user skips this step due to this confusion, the rest of the tutorial might fail. If you write “Restart the service”, you remove all doubt. This also clarifies that the user restarts the service.
