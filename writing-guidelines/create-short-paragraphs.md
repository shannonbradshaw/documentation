## Create Short Paragraphs
Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand than longer ones. Use the following guidelines for paragraphs:
- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.
- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences.
- Avoid having one-sentence paragraphs.
- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and between paragraphs.
- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of embedding the items in a paragraph.
- The following examples show how you can break up a long paragraph. Use a list so the user can scan the text.
