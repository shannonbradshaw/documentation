## Place Examples Early in each Section

Users prefer to read as little of your documentation as they can. Help them achieve this goal! Create illustrative examples before you write anything. Place examples as near the beginning of each section as you can, but definitely above the fold for common screen sizes. Assume users will skip over any introductory text you have provided in a section and go straight to trying to understand examples.

Assume users will try any examples you provide and only read if they encounter a problem. Provide troubleshooting guidance to support this mode of using your documentation. Ensure all examples work. Provide users with the full context on assumed platforms and other environmental details from which an example was generated.
