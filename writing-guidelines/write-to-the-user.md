## Write to the User

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. Use second person to talk to users directly, addressing the user as you. Second person promotes a friendly tone. 

Use second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject you is understood) and active voice to eliminate wordiness and confusion about who or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps.

Examples:
- Use the following configuration if you want to enable authentication.
- Enter your access keys.
- Install and configure the AWS Command Line Inerface. (imperative)
