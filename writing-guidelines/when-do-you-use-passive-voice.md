## When Do You Use Passive Voice?

You can use passive voice when using active voice will create one of the following problems:
- Sounds like you’re blaming the user. For example, you can use passive voice in an error message or troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
- Makes the sentence wordy or awkward.
- Would emphasize the performer when you don’t know the performer of action or you want to de-emphasize the performer in favor the object on which the action is performed.

| Acceptable (passive) | Avoid (active) | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A flag was set incorrectly. | You set the flag incorrectly. | The active voice blames the user. |
| Account owners can’t be assigned additional roles, and their access can’t be restricted. | Administrators can’t assign account owners additional roles, and they can’t restrict the access of account owners. | In this context, the object, account owners, is more important than the actor, administrators. |
