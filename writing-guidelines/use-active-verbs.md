## Use Active Verbs

Verbs carry the action in a sentence. Use active verbs rather than verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their variants). 

Avoid gerunds (-ing words) and nominalizations (making nouns from verbs) make the nouns carry the action and weaken the meaning. Replace weak verbs and gerunds with strong, action-oriented verbs to restore focus to verbs from nouns.
