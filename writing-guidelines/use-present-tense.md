## Use Present Tense

Users read content to learn how to perform tasks or to gather information. These activities occur in the usersâ€™ present time. This makes the present tense appropriate in most cases. The present tense implies that users should take action now. Sentences that use the present tense are easier to read than sentences that use past or future tense.
