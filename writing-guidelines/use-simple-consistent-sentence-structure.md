## Use Simple, Consistent Sentence Structure

- As often as possible, use the sentence structure subject-verb-object.
- Use simple declarative sentences for descriptions.
- Use simple imperative sentences for instructions.
- Sentences that describe a condition should always begin with the conditional clause, so that the user can skip the section if the condition does not apply to them.
- Don’t make users backtrack to understand a sentence. If they can’t understand the beginning of the sentence without reading the end, rewrite the sentence.
