## Titles and Headings

### Semantics
- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive titles and headings, and place the most important words first.
- Create titles that clearly describe what the page is about for a user who is unfamiliar with the product. E.g., use “Hyperparameter tuning” instead of “Katib.”
- Create titles that don’t rely on body text or other titles for their meaning (that are, in other words, independent of context). Users should be able to tell from a title whether the information in the article is relevant to their needs. Avoid ambiguous one-word titles, such as “Overview.” E.g., “Submit Kubernetes resources from a Jupyter notebook” instead of “Submit Kubernetes Resources.” This is important for SEO and for readability in search results. It also bulletproofs against introducing a confusing experience if a page is reorganized into a different section for some reason.
- Ensure that each title and heading is unique within a given content set.

### Capitalization
- Use headline-style capitalization for most titles and headings, including article, chapter, table, figure, and example titles, as well as section and procedure headings. Headline-style capitalization uses initial uppercase letters for the first, last, and all the significant words in the title. Capitalize all words in the title except for the following types of words:
  - Articles (a, an, the) unless the article is the first word in the title or follows a colon
  - Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, nor, or, yet, so) unless the conjunction is the first word in the title
  - Prepositions of any length, unless the preposition is the first or the last word in the title or is part of a verb phrase
  - The word to in an infinitive phrase unless to is the first word in the title
  - Second elements attached by hyphens to prefixes unless they’re proper nouns or proper adjectives
  - Words that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as literal command names or certain product or software names
- Use sentence-style capitalization for titles of steps in step files.

### Style and Structure
- Ensure page titles are the same wherever they are displayed. Do not shorten titles to make them fit a table of contents or navigation element.
- Include articles, prepositions, and punctuation as needed for clarity. However, avoid using an article (a, an, or the) as the first word.
- Avoid showing both an abbreviation and its spelled-out term in a title or heading. To help control the length of titles and headings, show the abbreviation in the title or heading and then define it in the first paragraph of the text.
- Don’t end a title or heading with a colon or period. If the title or heading is in the form of a question, end it with a question mark.
- Avoid having only a single heading at any level (for example, a single subsection in an article or section). If you find that you have a single heading at any one level, consider whether you can reorganize the information to either eliminate the heading or add a second one at that level.
- Avoid having more than two levels of sections within an article or topic. If you use more than two levels of sections, consider whether you can reorganize to make the structure flatter.
- Don’t “stack” titles or headings. That is, don’t immediately follow a title or heading with another title or heading. Text should always intervene between them. Ensure that such text is meaningful. If it is just filler text, consider whether you can restructure the content.
- Use a consistent grammatical structure for the titles and headings of specific types of content:

  | content | grammar | example |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | conceptual | Any grammatical structure that's appropriate except a verb, gerund, or infinitive | Contribute to Kubeflow |
  | step-by-step instructions | An imperative verb | Install Kubeflow |
  | tutorial or high-level process | A gerund | Managing an EKS Cluster |
  | reference | A plural noun or noun phrase | Kubeflow Versioning Policies |
